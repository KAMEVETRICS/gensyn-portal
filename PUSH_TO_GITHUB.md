# Push to GitHub - Final Steps

Your code is committed and ready! Follow these steps:

## 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `gensyn-art-portal` (or any name you prefer)
3. Description: "Art gallery platform where creators can upload artwork"
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (you already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Code

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Run this in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gensyn-art-portal.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Verify

Check your GitHub repository - all 58 files should be there!
